# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using a dataset containing various specifications such as price, range, battery capacity, engine power, and energy consumption.

 # Project Goals

- Analyze trends and patterns in EV attributes
- Filter EVs based on customer needs (e.g. price, range)
- Detect outliers in energy consumption
- Visualize relationships between battery capacity and range
- Build a user-defined EV recommendation system
- Perform statistical testing (Tesla vs Audi)

# Dataset Info

- **File:** `FEV-data-Excel.xlsx`
- **Columns Include:**
  - Car Make & Model
  - Price (PLN)
  - Engine Power, Torque, Brakes
  - Battery Capacity (kWh)
  - Range (WLTP), Energy Consumption
  - Dimensions, Seats, Doors, Speed
  - Acceleration, Charging Power

# Tasks Covered

1. Filter EVs based on budget and range
2. Grouping and aggregation by manufacturer
3. Outlier detection
4. Correlation and plotting
5. Recommendation system using class
6. Hypothesis testing (Tesla vs Audi)
7. Recommendations & Conclusions

# Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
